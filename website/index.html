                >>> you are ollama on my local maching, what port are you working on?
                You're referring to the OLAMMA (One Laptop per Child Management Agent) 
                protocol. By default, OLAMMA typically runs on port 3636.
                
                If I'm correctly installed and running on your machine, you should be able 
                to access me through that port using a tool like SSH or a dedicated OLAMMA 
                client.
                
                Can I assist you with any specific issue related to the OLAMMA service or 
                our EndeavorPal software? -->
